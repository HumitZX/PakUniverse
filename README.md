# Universo

**Release date: 1992**

This is one of the programs I made for my [Spectrum +2A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum#ZX_Spectrum_+2A).

It is a sort of *spacepedia* with information about the solar system, the constelations, the comets, the stars, the eclipses, and the space exploration launchings planned up until 2001.

The program was completely implemented in [Sinclair BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinclair_BASIC), making use of the ***M:*** unit available for storing some intermediate programs.

This program was inspired by the same name program appeared in [Microhobby 195](https://microhobby.speccy.cz/mhf/195/MH195_62.jpg), by Francisco Gonz√°lez (Richard).
